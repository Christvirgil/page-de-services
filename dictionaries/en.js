  about_title: "My Story: From Obstacle to Expertise",
  about_subtitle: "Discover the journey that forged me into a Laravel developer and an expert in solving complex problems.",
  about_h2_1: "First Steps: An Ambitious Project and an Unexpected Hurdle",
  about_p1_1: "My web development adventure began with an ambitious project: creating a sports betting site. The idea was to allow users to test their predictions with virtual tokens—a kind of practice betting API. The concept was clear, and the enthusiasm was high.",
  about_p1_2: "However, I quickly hit a technical wall that would become a turning point in my learning journey: the <strong>CSRF token mismatch</strong> error. This issue, related to web form security, was a real headache for me at the time. It blocked all interactions, rendering the site unusable. It was a tough nut to crack, forcing me to revisit my foundational knowledge of <strong>web security</strong>.",
  about_h2_2: "Laravel: The Revelation and Daily Challenges",
  about_p2_1: "Facing this difficulty, I decided to dive into the world of <strong>Laravel</strong>. This PHP framework, known for its elegance and robustness, became my primary tool. I learned to use it to build solid <strong>betting APIs</strong>, where users automatically receive 1000 tokens upon registration to test their prediction strategies. The API is now fully functional, just waiting to be deployed.",
  about_p2_2: "My journey with Laravel wasn't a smooth ride. I abandoned and restarted the project several times, facing a multitude of challenges: a simple <code>#</code> character in an <code>.env</code> file blocking data because it's treated as a comment, an unclosed function causing parsing errors, or server configuration issues. Every problem was a new lesson.",
  about_h2_3: "Perseverance: The Key to Technical Problem-Solving",
  about_p3_1: "What I learned from these experiences is that <strong>perseverance</strong> and a thorough reading of the documentation are the keys to <strong>technical problem-solving</strong>. Every obstacle, even the most frustrating one like the CSRF token error, is an opportunity to deeply understand the mechanics of web development and <strong>software engineering</strong>.",
  about_p3_2: "Today, these past challenges have become my strengths. I am able to anticipate issues, diagnose errors quickly, and implement robust and sustainable solutions. My experience with Laravel and APIs, forged in solving real-world problems, is what I now offer to my clients.",
  about_h2_4: "Ready to Turn Your Challenges into Successes?",
